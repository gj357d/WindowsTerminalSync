# WindowsTerminalSync
This script synchronizes the wt.exe settings.json file. The source location and destination location are set in it. Run this .bat file using Task Scheduler from Windows and it will be hidden in the background.

The principle of this script is that it compares the MD5 Hash of individual files and then determines which file is newer according to LastWriteTime. Subsequently, a simple condition copies the file in the right direction.

You can use Microsoft OneDrive, Drive by Google, DropBox, Syncthing, Resilio Sync... to sync a file between devices and the same .bat file on another device.
